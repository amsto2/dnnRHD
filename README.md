Machine learning for classification of advanced rheumatic heart disease from wearable electrocardiogram signals

This repo contains code snippets used for the aforementioned paper. In this work we apply classical machine learning models and CNN models to perfrom detection of RHD from healthy subjects.

The extracted time-frequency features and raw ECG of 10-second duration were used for classification. We evaluated different experiments and the obtained results suggest potential use of ECGs in RHD detection, helping in reduction of disease intervention burden particularly at resource onstrained medical setting.
